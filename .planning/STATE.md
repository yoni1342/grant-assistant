## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: 6-phase structure following architectural dependencies (foundation → pipeline → documents → proposals → budget/submission → awards/analytics)
- Research recommendations: Establish fire-and-forget n8n webhook pattern early (Phase 2) to avoid timeout issues in later phases
- Coverage validation: All 68 v1 requirements mapped to phases with no orphans

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 readiness:**
- Need to validate existing n8n workflows are functional before integration work begins
- Need to decide: Google Drive vs Supabase Storage for document management (impacts Phase 3)

**General:**
- Plane data migration strategy needs mapping exercise before Phase 1 schema design
- Multi-tenant considerations: v1 is single-org, but schema should be designed for future SaaS expansion
